        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Natasha Kemunto, an aspiring female in tech with a passion for both front-end and back-end development. I joined Moringa School to enhance my skills and grow as a developer, where I have been learning the latest technologies and best practices in the industry. Currently, I am also a student at university, pursuing my degree while diving deeper into the world of technology and coding. My journey in tech has been incredibly rewarding, and I am excited to continue learning and contributing to innovative projects. When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in a variety of hobbies that keep my creativity flowing. I enjoy photography, capturing moments and exploring the beauty of nature through my lens. Reading is another passion of mine, especially in the genres of science fiction and technology, as it inspires my work. I love traveling, as exploring new places and cultures broadens my perspective. Cooking is a fun way for me to unwind, where I experiment with new recipes and cuisines. Additionally, I stay active through running and yoga, which helps me maintain a balanced lifestyle. I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems, and I am committed to using my skills to make a positive impact. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work!
